I've modified the code a bit and found a way to add graphics for the head and tail of the snake I could not find a suitable method of scaling up the quality of the images in the canvas as a result they look blurry, I've tried a few fixes to no avail. I've also left a lot of comments that along with Andres's article may help you understand what's going on.
